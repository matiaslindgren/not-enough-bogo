    Well it is certainly not the most useful one.

    The randomized bogosort algorithm has an unbounded worst-case time complexity,
    which means the amount of time required to sort a sequence is unknown.
    It is not difficult to come up with examples which work essentially in the same way as the randomized bogosort algorithm.
    Lets say you would like to play Chopin's Etude Op.25 No.9 but you have never practiced the piece.
    Lets say there is only one sequence (ignoring dynamics and all the fancy artistic stuff) of notes which is considered the 'correct' way to play the piece.
    Finding this sequence using a bogosort algorithm would work as follows:
    <p>

    <ol>
      <li>Press random piano keys.</li>
      <li>If the piece was not Chopin's Etude Op.25 No.9, go to 1.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>
    This ridiculousness may rightly be dismissed as inefficiency but I find all kinds of dadaistic stupidity quite calming due to its non-belligerent and casual nature.
    Moreover, the simple thought of optimizing a multi-pivot, in-place quicksort algorithm, while sobbingly tinkering with 9 different C++ pointers due to off-by-one errors makes me want to sell all of my electronic equipment and start a new life as a panda baby, just rolling around and gnawing on interesting objects.
    Besides, <a href="{{ url_for('awesome') }}">this random shuffle</a> of 10 000 elements looks pretty damn awesome, don't you think?
